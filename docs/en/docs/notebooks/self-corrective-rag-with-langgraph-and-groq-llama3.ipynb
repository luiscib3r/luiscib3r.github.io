FAIR was officially announced in September 2013. FAIR was first directed by New York University's Yann LeCun, a deep learning professor and Turing Award winner. Working with NYU's Center for Data Science, FAIR's initial goal was to research data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence and to \"understand intelligence, to discover its fundamental principles, and to make machines significantly more intelligent\". Research at FAIR pioneered the technology that led to face recognition, tagging in photographs, and personalized feed recommendation. Vladimir Vapnik, a pioneer in statistical learning, joined FAIR in 2014. Vapnik is the co-inventor of the support-vector machine and one of the developers of the Vapnik–Chervonenkis theory.\n",
      "FAIR opened a research center in Paris, France in 2015, and subsequently launched smaller satellite research labs in Seattle, Pittsburgh, Tel Aviv, Montreal and London. In 2016, FAIR partnered with Google, Amazon, IBM, and Microsoft in creating the Partnership on Artificial Intelligence to Benefit People and Society, an organization with a focus on open licensed research, supporting ethical and efficient research practices, and discussing fairness, inclusivity, and transparency.\n",
      "In 2018, Jérôme Pesenti, former CTO of IBM's big data group, assumed the role of president of FAIR, while LeCun stepped down to serve as chief AI scientist. In 2018, FAIR was placed 25th in the AI Research Rankings 2019, which ranked the top global organizations leading AI research. FAIR quickly rose to eighth position in 2019, and maintained eighth position in the 2020 rank. FAIR had approximately 200 staff in 2018, and had the goal to double that number by 2020.\n",
      "FAIR's initial work included research in learning-model enabled memory networks, self-supervised learning and generative adversarial networks, text classification and translation, as well as computer vision. FAIR released Torch deep-learning modules as well as PyTorch in 2017, an open-source machine learning framework, which was subsequently used in several deep learning technologies, such as Tesla's autopilot  and Uber's Pyro. Also in 2017, FAIR discontinued a research project once AI bots developed a language that was unintelligible to humans, inciting conversations about dystopian fear of artificial intelligence going out of control. However, FAIR clarified that the research had been shut down because they had accomplished their initial goal to understand how languages are generated, rather than out of fear.\n",

      "Article URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llama_(language_model)\n",
      "Article Content: Llama (acronym for Large Language Model Meta AI, and formerly stylized as LLaMA) is a family of autoregressive large language models (LLMs) released by Meta AI starting in February 2023. The latest version is Llama 3.1, released in July 2024.\n",
      "Model weights for the first version of Llama were made available to the research community under a non-commercial license, and access was granted on a case-by-case basis. Unauthorized copies of the model were shared via BitTorrent. In response, Meta AI issued DMCA takedown requests against repositories sharing the link on GitHub. Subsequent versions of Llama were made accessible outside academia and released under licenses that permitted some commercial use. Llama models are trained at different parameter sizes, ranging between 7B and 405B. Originally, Llama was only available as a foundation model. Starting with Llama 2, Meta AI started releasing instruction fine-tuned versions alongside foundation models.\n",
      "Alongside the release of Llama 3, Meta added virtual assistant features to Facebook and WhatsApp in select regions, and a standalone website. Both services use a Llama 3 model.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the release of large language models such as GPT-3, a focus of research was up-scaling models which in some instances showed major increases in emergent capabilities. The release of ChatGPT and its surprise success caused an increase in attention to large language models.\n",
      "Compared with other responses to ChatGPT, Meta's Chief AI scientist Yann LeCun stated that large language models are best for aiding with writing.\n",
      "\n",
      "LLaMA was announced on February 24, 2023, via a blog post and a paper describing the model's training, architecture, and performance. The inference code used to run the model was publicly released under the open-source GPLv3 license. Access to the model's weights was managed by an application process, with access to be granted \"on a case-by-case basis to academic researchers; those affiliated with organizations in government, civil society, and academia; and industry research laboratories around the world\".\n",
      "Llama was trained on only publicly available information, and was trained at various model sizes, with the intention to make it more accessible to different hardware.\n",
      "Meta AI reported the 13B parameter model performance on most NLP benchmarks exceeded that of the much larger GPT-3 (with 175B parameters), and the largest 65B model was competitive with state of the art models such as PaLM and Chinchilla.\n",
      "\n",
      "On March 3, 2023, a torrent containing LLaMA's weights was uploaded, with a link to the torrent shared on the 4chan imageboard and subsequently spread through online AI communities. That same day, a pull request on the main LLaMA repository was opened, requesting to add the magnet link to the official documentation. On March 4, a pull request was opened to add links to HuggingFace repositories containing the model. On March 6, Meta filed takedown requests to remove the HuggingFace repositories linked in the pull request, characterizing it as \"unauthorized distribution\" of the model. HuggingFace complied with the requests. On March 20, Meta filed a DMCA takedown request for copyright infringement against a repository containing a script that downloaded LLaMA from a mirror, and GitHub complied the next day.\n",
      "Reactions to the leak varied. Some speculated that the model would be used for malicious purposes, such as more sophisticated spam. Some have celebrated the model's accessibility, as well as the fact that smaller versions of the model can be run relatively cheaply, suggesting that this will promote the flourishing of additional research developments. Multiple commentators, such as Simon Willison, compared LLaMA to Stable Diffusion, a text-to-image model which, unlike comparably sophisticated models which preceded it, was openly distributed, leading to a rapid proliferation of associated tools, techniques, and software.\n",

There is not a definitive answer, and thinking or discourse on the topic is sought in the English language through the question, \"What is the meaning of life?\" (or the related \"Why are we here?\" or \"What is the purpose of existence?\"). There have been many proposed answers to these questions from many different cultural and ideological backgrounds.

Science also studies and can provide recommendations for the pursuit of well-being and a related conception of morality. An alternative, humanistic approach poses the question, \"What is the meaning of my life?\"\\n\\n\\n== Origin of the expression ==\\n\\nThe first English use of the expression \"meaning of life\" appears in Thomas Carlyle\\'s Sartor Resartus (1833–1834), book II chapter IX, \"The Everlasting Yea\". Our Life is compassed round with Necessity; yet is the meaning of Life itself no other than Freedom, than Voluntary Force: thus have we a warfare; in the beginning, especially, a hard-fought battle.Carlyle may have been inspired by earlier usage of the equivalent German expression der Sinn des Lebens by German Romantic writers Novalis and Friedrich Schlegel. Schlegel was the first to use it in print by way of his novel Lucinde (1799), though Novalis had done so in a 1797–1798 manuscript, in which he wrote: \"Only an artist can divine the meaning of life.\" Additionally, the word lebenssinn, translated as life\\'s meaning, had been used by Goethe in a 1796 letter to Schiller. These authors grappled with the rationalism and materialism of modernity. Carlyle called this the \"Torch of Science\", which burned \"more fiercely than ever\" and made religion \"all parched away, under the Droughts of practical and spiritual Unbelief\", resulting in the \"Wilderness\" of \"the wide World in an Atheistic Century\".\\n\\n\\n== Origin of the question ==\\nArthur Schopenhauer was the first to explicitly ask the question, in an essay entitled \"Character\".Since a man does not alter, and his moral character remains absolutely the same all through his life; since he must play out the part which he has received, without the least deviation from the character; since neither experience, nor philosophy, nor religion can effect any improvement in him, the question arises, What is the meaning of life at all? To what purpose is it played, this farce in which everything that is essential is irrevocably fixed and determined?Questions about the meaning of life, and similar, have been expressed in a broad variety of other ways, including:\\nWhat is the meaning of life? What\\'s it all about? Who are we?\\nWhy are we here? What are we here for?\\nWhat is the origin of life?\\nWhat is the nature of life? What is the nature of reality?\\nWhat is the purpose of life? What is the purpose of one\\'s life?\\nWhat is the significance of life? (See also #Psychological significance and value in life)\\nWhat is meaningful and valuable in life?\\nWhat is the value of life?\\nWhat is the reason to live? What are we living for?\\nThese'),\n",

Arthur spends the next several years, still wearing his dressing gown, helplessly launched from crisis to crisis while trying to straighten out his lifestyle. He rather enjoys tea, but seems to have trouble obtaining it in the far reaches of the galaxy. In time, he learns how to fly and carves a niche for himself as a sandwich-maker. He is also worried about \"everything.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Ford Prefect ===\\nFord Prefect is Arthur Dent\\'s friend–and rescuer, when the Earth is unexpectedly demolished to make way for a hyperspace bypass at the start of the story. Although his heart is in the right place and he is shown to be highly intelligent, resourceful, and even brave, Ford is essentially a dilettante when it comes to causes such as the search for the question to the ultimate answer of \"life, the universe, and everything.\" Ford takes a more existential view of the universe, sometimes bordering on joyful nihilism. He is eccentric and broad-minded–no doubt due to his vast experience of roughing it around the galaxy – and has an off-key and often very dark sense of humour.\\n\\n\\n=== Zaphod Beeblebrox ===\\nZaphod Beeblebrox is a \"semi-half-cousin\" of Ford Prefect. He is hedonistic and irresponsible, narcissistic, and often extremely insensitive to the feelings of those around him. Zaphod invented the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster. Zaphod wears unique clothing that contains a mixture of bright and contrasting colours to make him stand out and be the centre of attention wherever he goes. He was voted \"Worst Dressed Sentient Being in the Known Universe\" seven consecutive times. He\\'s been described as \"the best Bang since the Big One\" by Eccentrica Gallumbits, and as \"one hoopy frood\" by others. He was briefly the President of the Galaxy and is the only man to have survived the Total Perspective Vortex (In the artificial galaxy created by Zarniwoop).\\n\\n\\n=== Marvin the Paranoid Android ===\\nMarvin the Paranoid Android is the ship\\'s robot aboard the starship Heart of Gold. Built as one of many failed prototypes of Sirius Cybernetics Corporation\\'s GPP (Genuine People Personalities) technology, Marvin is afflicted with severe depression and boredom, in part because he has a \"brain the size of a planet\" which he is seldom, if ever, given the chance to use. Indeed, the true horror of Marvin\\'s existence is that no task he could be given would occupy even the tiniest fraction of his vast intellect. Marvin claims he is 50,000 times more intelligent than a human.\\n\\n\\n=== Trillian ===\\nTrillian (Tricia McMillan) is a mathematician and astrophysicist whom Arthur Dent attempted to talk to at a party in Islington. She and Arthur next meet six months later on the spaceship Heart of Gold, shortly after the Earth has been destroyed to make way for a hyperspace bypass.\\n\\n\\n=== Slartibartfast ===\\nSlartibartfast is a Magrathean, and a designer of planets. His favourite part of the job is creating coastlines, the most notable of which are the fjords found on the coast of Norway on planet Earth, for which he won an award. When Earth Mk. II is being made, Slartibartfast is assigned to the continent of Africa. He is unhappy about this because he has begun \"doing it with fjords again\" (arguing that they give a continent a lovely baroque feel), but has been told by his superiors that they are \"not equatorial enough\". In relation to this, he expresses the view that he would \"far rather be happy than right any day.\"\\n\\n\\n== Minor characters ==\\n\\n\\n=== Agrajag ===\\nAgrajag is a tragic and piteous creature who is continually reincarnated and subsequently killed, each time unknowingly, by Arthur D'),\n",

This exerts pressure on the surrounding rock, and can progressively splinter and remove pieces. Over time, the cracks can grow, sometimes forming a cave. The splinters fall to the sea bed where they are subjected to further wave action.\\n\\n\\n=== Attrition ===\\nAttrition occurs when waves cause loose pieces of rock debris (scree) to collide with each other, grinding and chipping each other, progressively becoming smaller, smoother and rounder. Scree also collides with the base of the cliff face, chipping small pieces of rock from the cliff or have a corrasion (abrasion) effect, similar to sandpapering.\\n\\n\\n=== Solution ===\\nSolution is the process in which acids contained in sea water will dissolve some types of rock such as chalk or limestone.\\n\\n\\n=== Abrasion ===\\nAbrasion, also known as corrasion, occurs when waves break on cliff faces and slowly erode it. As the sea pounds cliff faces it also uses the scree from other wave actions to batter and break off pieces of rock from higher up the cliff face which can be used for this same wave action and attrition.\\n\\n\\n=== Corrosion ===\\nCorrosion or solution/chemical weathering occurs when the sea's pH (anything below pH 7.0) corrodes rocks on a cliff face. Limestone cliff faces, which have a moderately high pH, are particularly affected in this way. Wave action also increases the rate of reaction by removing the reacted material.\\n\\n\\n== Factors that influence erosion rates ==\\n\\n\\n=== Primary factors ===\\n\\nThe ability of waves to cause erosion of the cliff face depends on many factors.\\nThe hardness (or inversely, the erodibility) of sea-facing rocks is controlled by the rock strength and the presence of fissures, fractures, and beds of non-cohesive materials such as silt and fine sand.\\nThe rate at which cliff fall debris is removed from the foreshore depends on the power of the waves crossing the beach. This energy must reach a critical level to remove material from the debris lobe. Debris lobes can be very persistent and can take many years to completely disappear.\\nBeaches dissipate wave energy on the foreshore and provide a measure of protection to the adjoining land.\\nThe stability of the foreshore, or its resistance to lowering. Once stable, the foreshore should widen and become more effective at dissipating the wave energy, so that fewer and less powerful waves reach beyond it. Th\"),\n",

It forms by devitrification of volcanic ash or tuff, typically in a marine environment. This results in a very soft, porous rock that may contain residual crystals of more resistant minerals, and which feels soapy or greasy to the touch. However, in commercial and industrial applications, the term bentonite is used more generally to refer to any swelling clay composed mostly of smectite clay minerals, which includes montmorillonite. The undifferentiated reference to the weathered volcanic rock for the geologist or to the industrial mixture of swelling clays can be a source of confusion.\\nThe montmorillonite making up bentonite is an aluminium phyllosilicate mineral whose crystal structure is described as low-charge TOT. This means that a crystal of montmorillonite consists of layers, each of which is made up of two T sheets bonded to either side of an O sheet. The T sheets are so called because each aluminium or silicon ion in the sheet is surrounded by four oxygen ions arranged as a tetrahedron. The O sheets are so called because each aluminium ion is surrounded by six oxygen or hydroxyl ions arranged as an octahedron. The complete TOT layer has a weak negative electrical charge, and this is neutralized by calcium or sodium cations that bind adjacent layers together, with a distance between layers of about 1 nanometer. Because the negative charge is weak, only a fraction of the possible cation sites on the surface of a TOT layer actually contain calcium or sodium. Water molecules can easily infiltrate between sheets and fill the remaining sites. This accounts for the swelling property of montmorillonite a'),\n",
       "  Document(metadata={'title': 'Marine habitat', 'summary': 'A marine habitat is a habitat that supports marine life. Marine life depends in some way on the saltwater that is in the sea (the term marine comes from the Latin mare, meaning sea or ocean). A habitat is an ecological or environmental area inhabited by one or more living  species. The marine environment supports many kinds of these habitats. \\nMarine habitats can be divided into coastal and open ocean habitats. Coastal habitats are found in the area that extends from as far as the tide comes in on the shoreline out to the edge of the continental shelf. Most marine life is found in coastal habitats, even though the shelf area occupies only seven percent of the total ocean area. Open ocean habitats are found in the deep ocean beyond the edge of the continental shelf.\\nAlternatively, marine habitats can be divided into pelagic and demersal zones. Pelagic habitats are found near the surface or in the open water column, away from the bottom of the ocean. Demersal habitats are near or on the bottom of the ocean. An organism living in a pelagic habitat is said to be a pelagic organism, as in pelagic fish.

By volume the ocean provides most of the habitable space on the planet.', 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_habitat'}, page_content=\"A marine habitat is a habitat that supports marine life. Marine life depends in some way on the saltwater that is in the sea (the term marine comes from the Latin mare, meaning sea or ocean). A habitat is an ecological or environmental area inhabited by one or more living  species. The marine environment supports many kinds of these habitats. \\nMarine habitats can be divided into coastal and open ocean habitats. Coastal habitats are found in the area that extends from as far as the tide comes in on the shoreline out to the edge of the continental shelf. Most marine life is found in coastal habitats, even though the shelf area occupies only seven percent of the total ocean area. Open ocean habitats are found in the deep ocean beyond the edge of the continental shelf.\\nAlternatively, marine habitats can be divided into pelagic and demersal zones. Pelagic habitats are found near the surface or in the open water column, away from the bottom of the ocean. Demersal habitats are near or on the bottom of the ocean. An organism living in a pelagic habitat is said to be a pelagic organism, as in pelagic fish. Similarly, an organism living in a demersal habitat is said to be a demersal organism, as in demersal fish. Pelagic habitats are intrinsically shifting and ephemeral, depending on what ocean currents are doing.\\nMarine habitats can be modified by their inhabitants. Some marine organisms, like corals, kelp, mangroves and seagrasses, are ecosystem engineers which reshape the marine environment to the point where they create further habitat for other organisms. By volume the ocean provides most of the habitable space on the planet.\\n\\n\\n== Overview ==\\n\\nIn contrast to terrestrial habitats, marine habitats are shifting and ephemeral. Swimming organisms find areas by the edge of a continental shelf a good habitat, but only while upwellings bring nutrient rich water to the surface. Shellfish find habitat on sandy beaches, but storms, tides and currents mean their habitat continually reinvents itself.\\nThe presence of seawater is common to all marine habitats. Beyond that many other things determine whether a marine area makes a good habitat and the type of habitat it makes. For example:\\n\\ntemperature – is affected by geographical latitude, ocean currents, weather, the discharge of rivers, and by the presence of hydrothermal vents or cold seeps\\nsunlight – photosynthetic processes depend on how deep and turbid the water is\\nnutrients – are transported by ocean currents to different marine habitats from land runoff, or by upwellings from the deep sea, or they sink through the sea as marine snow\\nsalinity – varies, particularly in estuaries or near river deltas, or by hydrothermal vents\\ndissolved gases – oxygen levels in particular, can be increased by wave actions and decreased during algal blooms\\nacidity – this is partly to do with dissolved gases above, since the acidity of the ocean is largely controlled by how much carbon dioxide is in the water.\\nturbulence –  ocean waves, fast currents and the agitation of water affect the nature of habitats\\ncover – the availability of cover such as the adjacency of the sea bottom, or the presence of floating objects\\nsubstrate – The slope, orientation, profile and rugosity of hard substrates, and particle size, sorting and density of unconsolidated sediment bottoms can make a big difference to the life forms that can settle on it.\\nthe occupying organisms themselves – since organisms modify their habitats by the act of occupying them, and some, like corals, kelp, mangroves and seagrasses, create further habitats for other organisms.\\n\\nThere are five major oceans, of which the Pacific Ocean is nearly as large as the rest put together. Coastlines fringe the land for nearly 380,000 kilometres.\\n\\nAltogether, the ocean occupies 71 percent of the world surface, averaging nearly four kilometres in depth. By volume, the ocean contains more than 99 percent of the Earth's liquid water. The science fiction writer Arthur C. Cla\")],\n",
